Arrays are static in nature, once initialized, the sizes cannot be changed 
unless by the compiler {static memory allocation}
Arrays is a collection of items of the same data type

Allow random access to elements. Can be accessed using loops
Makes Searching, Insertion and Access very easy

Arrays store every element in a single namespace hence can be easily accessed, all at once
