### The Kalman Filter
* The most common algorithm used in robotics.
~~~~
* Uses a series of measurements observed over time.
* Containing Noise - These are random variations & other inaccuracies.
* Produces estimates of unknown variables.
* The estimates are more precise than those based on a single measurement.
